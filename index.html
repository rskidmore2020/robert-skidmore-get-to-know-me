                        Robert Skidmore is a family man how loves to spend his spare time with his family doing thinks like camping in the woods and doing family movie nights in the living room with a big bowl of popcorn. Robert is also an avid cyclist with his wife, riding on average of 60 miles a week (they would ride more if time permitted). 
                        Robert has spent the last 9 years of his career working in the mortgage industry.  A few years ago, he was selected to join a small team to launch a new loan program to offer VA loans to the bank’s customers, who up to this point were limited in their loan options if they were to get a loan with the back that he works. During the development process, he tested the computer systems to debug any issues that might one may encounter during the processing of a VA loan. He also developed job aids and an interactive checklist in excel for future processors to use when processing a VA loan. Subsequently he was asked to develop an interactive checklist for all the other loan programs that the bank offers, and is now currently used company wide. Robert enjoy this time developing new tools for the back to use so much that he has decided to pursue becoming a certified full stack web developer. He envisions himself being able to develop even more powerful and useful tools for the company that he works for.
